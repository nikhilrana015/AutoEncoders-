# AutoEncoders

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The goal of an autoencoder is to:

learn a representation for a set of data, usually for dimensionality reduction by training the network to ignore signal noise.
Along with the reduction side, a reconstructing side is also learned, where the autoencoder tries to generate from the reduced encoding a representation as close as possible to its original input. This helps autoencoders to learn important features present in the data.

When a representation allows a good reconstruction of its input then it has retained much of the information present in the input. Recently, the autoencoder concept has become more widely used for learning generative models of data.


# Denoising Autoencoder
Denoising autoencoders create a corrupted copy of the input by introducing some noise. This helps to avoid the autoencoders to copy the input to the output without learning features about the data. These autoencoders take a partially corrupted input while training to recover the original undistorted input. The model learns a vector field for mapping the input data towards a lower dimensional manifold which describes the natural data to cancel out the added noise.

# Sparse Autoencoder
Sparse autoencoders have hidden nodes greater than input nodes. They can still discover important features from the data. A generic sparse autoencoder is visualized where the obscurity of a node corresponds with the level of activation. Sparsity constraint is introduced on the hidden layer. This is to prevent output layer copy input data. Sparsity may be obtained by additional terms in the loss function during the training process, either by comparing the probability distribution of the hidden unit activations with some low desired value,or by manually zeroing all but the strongest hidden unit activations. Some of the most powerful AIs in the 2010s involved sparse autoencoders stacked inside of deep neural networks.

# Deep Autoencoder
Deep Autoencoders consist of two identical deep belief networks, oOne network for encoding and another for decoding. Typically deep autoencoders have 4 to 5 layers for encoding and the next 4 to 5 layers for decoding. We use unsupervised layer by layer pre-training for this model. The layers are Restricted Boltzmann Machines which are the building blocks of deep-belief networks. Processing the benchmark dataset MNIST, a deep autoencoder would use binary transformations after each RBM. Deep autoencoders are useful in topic modeling, or statistically modeling abstract topics that are distributed across a collection of documents. They are also capable of compressing images into 30 number vectors.

# Convolutional Autoencoder
Autoencoders in their traditional formulation does not take into account the fact that a signal can be seen as a sum of other signals. Convolutional Autoencoders use the convolution operator to exploit this observation. They learn to encode the input in a set of simple signals and then try to reconstruct the input from them, modify the geometry or the reflectance of the image. They are the state-of-art tools for unsupervised learning of convolutional filters. Once these filters have been learned, they can be applied to any input in order to extract features. These features, then, can be used to do any task that requires a compact representation of the input, like classification.

# Variational Autoencoder
Variational autoencoder models make strong assumptions concerning the distribution of latent variables. They use a variational approach for latent representation learning, which results in an additional loss component and a specific estimator for the training algorithm called the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes estimator. It assumes that the data is generated by a directed graphical model and that the encoder is learning an approximation to the posterior distribution where Ф and θ denote the parameters of the encoder (recognition model) and decoder (generative model) respectively. The probability distribution of the latent vector of a variational autoencoder typically matches that of the training data much closer than a standard autoencoder.
